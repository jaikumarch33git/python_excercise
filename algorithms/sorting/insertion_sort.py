# Insertion Sort
# This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted.
# For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in
# this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there.
# Hence the name, insertion sort.

# The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted
# sub-list (in the same array).
# This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and
# worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
